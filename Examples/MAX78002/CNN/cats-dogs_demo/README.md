# MAX78002 Cats vs Dogs Demo



Description
-----------

The model trained in this demo is used to classify images of cats and dogs. 25000 images dataset is used to train the model. The dataset can be downloaded using [https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) link. The input size is 64x64 pixels RGB which is 3x64x64 in CHW format.

The code uses a sampledata header (sampledata.h) file to test a pre-defined input sample. The example also supports live capture from camera module and displays the image on the TFT LCD. [TFT Capability TBD]

### Building firmware:

Navigate directory where **cats-dogs_demo** software is located and build the project:

```bash
$ cd /Examples/MAX78002/CNN/cats-dogs_demo
$ make -r
```

If this is the first time after installing tools, or peripheral files have been updated, first clean drivers before rebuilding the project: 

```bash
$ make -r distclean
```


### Load firmware image to MAX78002 EVKIT

Connect USB cable to CN2 (USB/PWR) and turn ON power switch (SW4).

Connect PICO adapter to JH8 SWD header.

If you are using Windows, load the firmware image with OpenOCD in a MinGW shell:

```bash
openocd -s $MAXIM_PATH/Tools/OpenOCD/scripts -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/max78002.cfg -c "program build/max78002.elf reset exit"
```

If using Linux, perform this step:

```bash
./openocd -f tcl/interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f tcl/target/max78002.cfg -c "program build/max78002.elf verify reset exit"
```

### MAX78002 EVKIT operations

* If using camera and TFT LCD, connect OVM7692 camera board using the cable and adapter board to 'JH17 Camera' header and place TFT display on the display header.

* **Make sure to set the JP41 DVP CAM Power to ON position**.

* Connect the DC 5V supply to MAX78002 evkit J1. Connect PICO adapter to JH8 SWD header. Turn the power switch SW1 to on position.

* To see debug messages, you can optionally connect a USB cable to CN2. Open a serial port application on the PC and connect to Ev-Kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1 configuration.

This demo is operated in two modes: Real-time data using Camera module or using sample image header file in offline mode.

In either mode, pushbutton trigger PB1(SW4) is used to capture and load an image into CNN engine. User is prompted to press PB1 to load an image

### Camera Mode 

To operate in this mode, comment out "#define USE\_SAMPLEDATA", defined in main.c.

This mode uses OVM7692 camera module to capture an image in RGB888 format. Since the model is trained using 64x64 pixel image, the PCIF peripheral captures 64x64 pixel image and displays it on LCD. [TFT TBD]

The data received from camera interface is an unsigned data and should be converted to signed data before feeding to the CNN network.

### Offline Mode

To operate in this mode, uncomment "#define USE\_SAMPLEDATA", defined in main.c. 

This mode uses a header file "sampledata.h" containing RGB image data and it should be included in the project to use it as an input to the cnn network. 

To create your own header file follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to Utility directory. $ cd Utility
2.  Download cat or dog image in this directory.
3.  Open 'rgb.py' file and change the name of the image file on line 8. im = (Image.open('image_filename.format')). Save the changes.
4.  Now generate a header file using this command: python3 rgb.py
5.  Use this header file in your main.c

Terminal output
---------------

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:
